## Licensing
Daboto code written by the owner of the repository and any contributors is fully licensed under the project license (GPL 3 as of writing this). Any other code is otherwise licensed under their own licenses - so do keep in mind those parts may not be compatible with the overall project license

## Description
Daboto started in 2021 as a Discord bot for 1. experimentation with Discord's API & 2. eventually as a full project for social Discord servers (whose "true" legacy was then replaced with [Revade](https://github.com/akripent/revade).). It began as a simple test ping/pong bot, and eventually commands were added as servers' needs were seen.

Initially, it began with Node.JS which Project Revade still uses to this day. Daboto was discontinued eventually sometime in 2022 in favor of full-on Revade development. Now Daboto is being started over from scratch to hopefully become an even better version.

As of 10 Jan. 2025, Daboto is being rewritten, and any progress will be followed below (No/Yes):
- Base bot (answering messages): No
- Moderation module: No
- ...
